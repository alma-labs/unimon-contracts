## üîÑ V1 to V2 Migration

Unimon has evolved from a Uniswap V4 Hook-based game to a standalone NFT collection game:

- **V1 (Hook Era)**: Game played through Uniswap swaps, energy from LP positions
- **V2 (Collection Era)**: Traditional NFT minting, evolution, and equipment systems
- **Migration Benefits**: V1 users receive airdropped gacha keys and mint coupons
- **Airdrop**: One-time `v1Airdrop()` function distributes items to qualifying addresses

## üìù Important Notes

- V2 contracts are completely standalone - no hook dependencies
- All items are ERC1155 tokens for gas efficiency
- Equipment modifies stats temporarily while equipped
- Evolution bonuses are permanent and random
- Max supply: 10,000 Unimon NFTs
- Custom names supported (1-24 characters)
